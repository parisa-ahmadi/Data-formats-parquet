# How to read this kind of data format locally? you can access this shortcode and install 2 dependencies of that in the notebook I uploaded in this repo.

Parquet is a columnar storage file format commonly used in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. It is designed to be highly efficient for big data processing and analytics. Parquet organizes data into columns rather than rows, allowing for better compression, faster query processing, and more efficient storage. This makes it particularly well-suited for analytical workloads that involve reading and processing large amounts of data. The columnar format of Parquet also enables selective columnar reads, which can significantly speed up queries that only require a subset of the columns. Overall, Parquet is widely used for big data analytics, especially in the context of Apache Spark and other Hadoop-based processing frameworks.
